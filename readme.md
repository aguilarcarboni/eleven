# Eleven
 
Eleven is a programming language made by Andres Aguilar for CS 1412.

This programming language combines the ease of use of Python with the functionality of C, 
since it can take advantage of pointers (strings).

Syntax:
All commands must start in new line.

Comments:
$$$ comment

Variable declarations:
int x = 5
string w = "stringy"

Strings can be indexed:
string s = copy(w[0])

Strings can be copied or concatenated:
concat(s, w)

Conditionals:
if condition: 
    statement
_
else if condition:
    statement
_
else:
    statement 
_

Math functions: (return a truncated int and print the float)
sin(angle)
cos(angle)
tan(angle)
PI = 3 (come on engineers!)

Write to console:
log(expression)

This is all you need to know. Happy coding with Eleven!
